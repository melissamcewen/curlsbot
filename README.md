This is a Facebook bot dedicated to the curly girl method of hair care pioneered by Lorraine Massey.

A lot of people are interested in properly caring for their naturally curly or wavy hair, but it can be confusing to find the right methods and products. This bot aims to make it all easier!


## Features

### Ingredient Analysis
Right now the main (OK one of the only) features is that you can send CurlyBot a list of ingredients for analysis. The analysis mainly focuses on finding out if the product has ingredients not allowed in the curly girl method, but in the future it may provide more detailed advice about other aspects of ingredients.

### About Curly Girl
The persistent menu in the chat box has a feature where you can click "About Curly Girl" for some quick info about the method.
